 # Important Details

 <br>
 The project took 8-10. This was my 1st time using flexbox on a project. Also, I needed to reference documentation to progress throught the project
 This project helped me get better with flexbox. Still have a lot to learn but I'm able to do somethings 
 Alot of the detailed positioning of elements was use with css

 <br>

## Biggest Challenges
- Using flexbox was a challenge. It's important to understand of flexbox and how the attributes works. I found myself searching alot of documentation for specific things.
- Tedious alignment and positioning of elements. Spend hours tweaking things to get the look I wanted.
 -Being patient. It took me a good amount of time to completed this project. Seeing other layouts from other engineers and the ones from youtube tutorials threw me off, because the feelings of doubt came in. I push forward and just keep tweaking things day by day until I had good layout.

 ## What I learned

 - Being patient. 
 - Staying proactive and trying different things
 - Don't compare your work to others
 - Take breaks! Pomodoro method was an important thing I used to help me do this project
